# py-experiments

Collection of experiments using Python language

I'm using this repository to test various features of the Python language, particularly small experiments
on using libraries, interesting code snippets, and algorithms that may come in handy in the future.

I'll try to keep this README.md file aligned with the code in the repository so that it can be used as an index of contents.
